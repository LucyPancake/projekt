            First things first
            I'ma say all the words inside my head

            The way that things have been, oh-ooh
            Second thing second
            Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
            I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
            The master of my sea, oh-ooh
            I was broken from a young age
            Taking my sulking to the masses
            Writing my poems for the few
            That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
            Singing from heartache from the pain
            Taking my message from the veins
            Speaking my lesson from the brain
            Seeing the beauty through the...

            Pain!
            Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
            My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
            First things first
            Can you imagine what's about to happen?
            It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
            And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
            This is what's happenin'
            Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
            Sound about accurate
            I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
            I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
            I know the passages come with some traffic
            I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
            And third thing third
            Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
            Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
            Is you a believer?
            I get a unicorn out of a zebra
            I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
            This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
            Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
            I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
            I know the losin' don't come without shame
            I know the beauty don't come without hurt
            Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
            I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
            I know that losin' don't come without game

            You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
            The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
            But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
            Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
            It rained down, like...
            Pain!
            You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
            Pain!
            You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

            When the days are cold
            And the cards all fold
            And the saints we see are all made of gold
            When your dreams all fail
            And the ones we hail
            Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
            I wanna hide the truth
            I wanna shelter you
            But with the beast inside
            There's nowhere we can hide
            No matter what we breed
            We still are made of greed
            This is my kingdom come
            This is my kingdom come
            When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
            It's where my demons hide
            It's where my demons hide
            Don't get too close, it's dark inside
            It's where my demons hide
            It's where my demons hide
            At the curtain's call
            It's the last of all
            When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
            So they dug your grave
            And the masquerade
            Will come calling out at the mess you've made
            Don't wanna let you down
            But I am hell-bound
            Though this is all for you
            Don't wanna hide the truth
            No matter what we breed
            We still are made of greed
            This is my kingdom come
            This is my kingdom come
            When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
            It's where my demons hide
            It's where my demons hide
            Don't get too close, it's dark inside
            It's where my demons hide
            It's where my demons hide
            They say it's what you make
            I say it's up to fate
            It's woven in my soul
            I need to let you go
            Your eyes, they shine so bright
            I wanna save that light
            I can't escape this now
            Unless you show me how
            When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
            It's where my demons hide
            It's where my demons hide
            Don't get too close, it's dark inside

        <pre class="lyrics">
            I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
            For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
            I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
            When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
            Tell you you're the greatest
            But once you turn, they hate us
            Oh, the misery
            Everybody wants to be my enemy
            Spare the sympathy
            Everybody wants to be my enemy
            (Look out for yourself)
            My enemy (look, look, look, look)
            (Look out for yourself)
            But I'm ready
            Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
            And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
            I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
            When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
            Tell you you're the greatest
            But once you turn, they hate us (huh)
            Oh, the misery
            Everybody wants to be my enemy
            Spare the sympathy
            Everybody wants to be
            My enemy (look, look, look, look)
            (Look out for yourself)
            My enemy (look, look, look, look) (yeah)
            (Look out for yourself)
            Uh, look
            Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
            I'm praying that somebody hope for me
            I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
            P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
            Ready to go whenever, just let me know
            The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
            The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
            I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
            They wanna plot on my trot to the top
            I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
            I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
            And it matters more because I had it not
            Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
            Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
            Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
            Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
            Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
            It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
            Everybody wants to be my enemy
            Spare the sympathy
            Everybody wants to be
            My enemy
            Oh, the misery
            Everybody wants to be my enemy
            Spare the sympathy
            Everybody wants to be my enemy
            Pray it away, I swear
            I'll never be a saint, no way
            My enemy
            Pray it away, I swear

            Drown out the voices in the air

            Whatever it takes
            Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for
            Whatever it takes
            'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
            I do what it takes
            Always had a fear of being typical
            Looking at my body feeling miserable
            Always hanging on to the visual
            I wanna be invisible
            Looking at my years like a martyrdom
            Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
            Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
            I was born to run, I was born for this
            Whip, whip
            Run me like a racehorse
            Pull me like a ripcord
            Break me down and build me up
            I wanna be the slip, slip
            Word upon your lip, lip
            Letter that you rip, rip
            Break me down and build me up
            Whatever it takes
            'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
            I do whatever it takes
            'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
            Whatever it takes
            Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
            Whatever it takes
            'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
            I do what it takes
            Hypocritical, egotistical
            Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
            Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
            An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
            I'm an apostrophe
            I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
            I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
            And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
            And when I am deceased
            At least I go down to the grave and die happily
            Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
            I do what it takes
            Whatever it takes
            'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
            I do whatever it takes
            'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
            Whatever it takes
            Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
            Whatever it takes
            'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
            I do what it takes

        <pre class="lyrics">Just a young gun with a quick fuse
            I was uptight, wanna let loose
            I was dreaming of bigger things
            And wanna leave my old life behind
            Not a yes-sir, not a follower
            Fit the box, fit the mold
            Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
            I was lightning before the thunder
            
            Thunder, thunder

            Kids were laughing in my classes
            While I was scheming for the masses
            Who do you think you are?
            Dreaming 'bout being a big star
            They say you're basic, they say you're easy
            You're always riding in the back seat
            Now I'm smiling from the stage while
            You were clapping in the nosebleeds

            Thunder, feel the thunder
            Lightning then the thunder

            Thunder, feel the thunder

        <pre class="lyrics">Will you hold the line
            When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
            In this house of mine
            Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
            Will the stars align?
            Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin, will it?
            'Cause this house of mine stands strong
            That's the price you pay
            Leave behind your heart and cast away
            Just another product of today
            Rather be the hunter than the prey
            And you're standing on the edge face up
            'Cause you're a natural
            A beating heart of stone
            You gotta be so cold
            To make it in this world
            Yeah, you're a natural
            Living your life cutthroat

            Yeah, you're a natural
            Will somebody
            Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
            What's happening?
            Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
            Oh, we are the youth
            Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, face it
            A bit of the truth, the truth
            That's the price you pay
            Leave behind your heart and cast away
            Just another product of today

            And you're standing on the edge face up

            You gotta be so cold
            Yeah, you're a natural
            Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
            Took an oath by the blood on my hand, won't break it
            I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
            Gonna make it
            I'm gonna make it
            Natural
            A beating heart of stone
            You gotta be so cold
            To make it in this world
            Yeah, you're a natural
            Living your life cutthroat
            You gotta be so cold

            Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
            And terrors don't prey on
            Innocent victims
            Trust me, darling, trust me, darling
            It's been a loveless year
            I'm a man of three fears
            Integrity, faith and
            Crocodile tears
            Trust me, darling, trust me, darling
            So look me in the eyes
            Tell me what you see
            Perfect paradise
            Tearing at the seams
            I wish I could escape
            I don't wanna fake it
            Wish I could erase it
            Make your heart believe
            But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
            Now you know
            Now you know
            I'm a bad liar, bad liar
            Now you know, you're free to go (go)
            Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
            Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
            Oh, I've been askin'
            Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems
            I wage my war, on the world inside
            I take my gun to the enemy's side
            Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
            Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
            Problems, problems, problems
            So look me in the eyes

            Perfect paradise
            Tearing at the seams
